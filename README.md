# Vegetation-Segmentation-using-U-Net-TensorFlow-
To build a deep learning system that identifies vegetation regions in images using pixel-wise segmentation

This project performs **binary semantic segmentation** to detect vegetation from drone or satellite images.  
The dataset is downloaded from **Roboflow** (YOLO polygon format) and is converted into **U-Net friendly masks** before training.

---

##  Project Overview

This project:

- Downloads dataset from Roboflow  
- Converts YOLO polygon annotations → binary mask images  
- Prepares data for U-Net (256×256 RGB images)  
- Builds and trains a U-Net model for segmentation  
- Evaluates the model using **Dice Score** and **IoU (Intersection over Union)**  
- Displays prediction results  

All code is rewritten, structured and commented for clarity.
